# Automatic Detection of bike riders without helmet

Automatic Detection of bike riders without helmet is an application which is used to check if a motorcyclist is wearing a helmet or not using OpenCV and also with the help of cascade classifiers. The accuracy of this particular application is not upto the mark as of now. Looking forward for improvement.
